# Mudbot

This is the public repository for the Mudbot code.

Mudbot is a Discord bot made by Dusk Argentum#6530 (97153790897045504) on Discord, made for use on the Aether Hunts (542602456132091904) Discord.

As a note, while you *could*, *technically* run this bot on another server, it is ill-advised; many parts of this bot function only within the parameters in the Aether Hunts server. This bot will not run out-of-the-box on any other server, and I will not be providing any support or troubleshooting to anyone who attempts to use this bot on another server. Please understand.
